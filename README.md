TwitchMarker
============

An easy way to never forget when to highlight video for twitch.tv. Used for streamers who dont want to write down the time
of a highlight on a piece of paper. This application does if for you. Hit a buttona and a text file will have the time, date,
game, and title of your current broadcast. Do as many highlights as you want it will all be waiting in the file for you. 
Forget to check your highlights from 2 days ago thats fine all your highlights will be in the text file so you can see exactly
when it happened. Also you don't have to be a streamer to use this program. Watching your favorite streamer and something awesome
happened hit that key and you will have that time save for future use. Enjoy!

Instructions
============

Open the .exe located in (Exe Folder) the program will now be running in the taskbar(bottom right). 
Right click on the icon and click settings this will bring up a page for you to type in your twitch name. Type in the twitch name(do not put twitch.tv/username, just do the username). To change the hotkey click in the textbox for the hotkey and hit the desired F key. Currently I only support the F keys I am working on expanding this. Once done with the application do not close out from the task manager, instead right click the icon in the taskbar and click exit. That way it will save your username and hotkey for the next time you launch the application.  A .txt file will be generated at theplace of the .exe. 

Current Limitations
====================

*Only the F keys are supported right now. Will be adding support to more keys soon.

*If you open the program during the stream the timer will be started at the time you opened the program. I haven't seen a way to 
get the time the stream has started from twitch. So make sure you always have the application setup before you start streaming.
